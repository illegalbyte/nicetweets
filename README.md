![Test Workflow](https://github.com/illegalbyte/nicetweets/actions/workflows/django.yml/badge.svg)

A twitter client built with Django which filters tweets using sentiment analysis and only shows positive tweets about a given topic.

## Install dependencies with `pip`

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Twitter API Authentication

At your terminal env the following command to authenticate with Twitter:

    export BEARER_TOKEN='<your_bearer_token>'

## Tweet Sentiment API

Once tweets have been created by searching a topic using the web UI, the sentiment analysis API can be used to get the sentiment of each tweet. The API is available at `/api/<topic>?format=json` and returns a JSON object:

```json

    "status":"ok",

        {
            "tweet_text":"Decided to make the 4 siblings in my Halfpelt series, all of them having their problems, and far from a perfect family!
